					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Try your best to avoid taking loans from the 401K account. The only exception I made once is removing a reasonable amount for the purchase of a home. I justified it because the payback was low interest and I was putting the money into another appreciating asset. I would always avoid removing the money for depreciating actions, like a car, vacation, new TV, home remodel, etc. Many folks tap the 401(k) for unexpected expenses, this is why an emergency fund is critical. Avoiding loans gets someone more compound growth! This will keep you happy. [&#8230;]]]></description>
