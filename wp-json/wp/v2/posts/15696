It sounds cliche, but I know it is true. Being a parent tests and challenges a person in so many ways, but at the end of the day I am quite happy for the challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also reminds me that even though there may be things about childhood and growing up that I miss, there are also many things I am glad are behind me. So, there is a point on the board for middle age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-increased-confidence-skills\"><strong>1. Increased Confidence &amp; Skills<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Middle age is often associated with increased self-awareness, confidence, and a greater sense of self. I admittedly still deal with self doubt and challenges in mid life, but I notice generally I have developed more skills and techniques to manage these emotions. People in their middle age tend to be more secure in their identity, have a better understanding of their values and goals, and have gained valuable life experiences that contribute to their overall confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am more secure than ever in expressing my views in a respectful manner, listening to others and being comfortable with disagreements. It is ok to live and let live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will add that at this age you have probably developed several skills. Think about those skills and passions. How can you turn them into a new adventure or creative pursuit that can lead to middle age happiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-15743 size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480\" alt=\"middle age happiness\" class=\"wp-image-15743\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/family-ties.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Back row: Michael Gross;<br>Middle row: Michael J.

Deeper Relationships<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Middle age can bring a sense of stability to relationships, as people tend to have established long-term friendships, romantic relationships, and Family Ties (yeah, we had to, sorry!). They may also have more time and resources to invest in building deeper, more meaningful connections with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dating has some nice memories and stories, but it cannot replace for me personally a committed deeper relationship with someone. And this is not easy, because we are making ourselves vulnerable to another person. As compared to dating when we are kind of putting on a show if you think about it. It is not bad, we must always strive to put our best foot forward. But the reality is that we are going to have good days and challenging times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-financial-stability\"><strong>3. Financial Stability<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We may not be <em>rich<\/em>, but we can be a lot more financially secure and stable by middle age. (Especially if a person has been <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\" target=\"_blank\">reading<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@MoneyVikings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watching Money Vikings<\/a> for the past few years \ud83d\ude42 )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By middle age, many people have established a stable career, accumulated wealth and assets, and have a better understanding of how to manage their finances. This financial stability can provide a sense of security and allow for greater freedom and flexibility in life choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-sense-of-purpose\"><strong>4. Sense of Purpose<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As people enter middle age, they may experience a renewed sense of purpose and direction. They may have accomplished many of their early life goals and are now ready to take on new challenges, pursue new interests, or give back to their communities. This can help lead to increased middle age happiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-increased-wisdom-experience\"><strong>5. Increased Wisdom &amp; Experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Middle age often brings a level of wisdom and perspective that can only be gained through experience. People in their middle age may be better equipped to handle life&#8217;s challenges and make more informed decisions based on their past experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may still need work and help evolving, but know in your heart that it is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-will-you-re-spark-joy\"><strong>How Will You Re-Spark Joy?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt that middle age brings its fair share of challenges. Now is a time for self-love and self-care as we work so hard to care for others. How can we find the little joys in life and be the best version we can create? Sometimes just watching that Netflix special is all it takes to bringing middle age happiness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can We Manifest Middle Age Happiness?<\/p>\n<p>The best is yet to come is a nice saying. it gives us hope and I believe it to be true.
