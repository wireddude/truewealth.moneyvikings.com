Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day \u2013 if you live long enough \u2013 most people get what they deserve.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It&#8217;s such a simple idea. It&#8217;s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;The best thing you can do is to keep learning. Never stop asking questions.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some interesting things about Charlie Munger<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"gE iv gt\">\n<table class=\"cf gJ\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"acZ xD\">\n<td colspan=\"3\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15608\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/munger-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C168\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><\/figure><p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"\">\n<div id=\":op\" class=\"ii gt\">\n<div id=\":oo\" class=\"a3s aiL \">\n<div dir=\"auto\">\n<ol>\n<li>Charlie Munger is best known for his role as the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate holding company led by Warren Buffett.<\/li>\n<li>Munger was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1924, and spent much of his childhood moving around the Midwest.

Saving money allows you to accumulate wealth over time and helps to create a financial cushion in case of unexpected events.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investing: Wealthy individuals tend to invest their money in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and businesses. Investing can help you grow your money over time and create passive income streams. Charlie Munger is famous for investing mainly in stocks, businesses and real estate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Living below your means: Another common habit of wealthy individuals is living below their means. This means that they spend less money than they earn and avoid debt whenever possible. Living below your means can help you build wealth by allowing you to save and invest more money. This is what Charlie is talking about when he says do everything you can invest your first $100k.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continual Learning: Many wealthy individuals are lifelong learners, constantly seeking to improve their skills and knowledge. This can help them stay ahead in their careers, identify new investment opportunities, and make informed decisions about their money. Charlie Munger is a life long learner!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Goal Setting: Successful people tend to be very goal-oriented, setting clear objectives for themselves and working tirelessly to achieve them. Setting financial goals can help you stay focused and motivated, whether you are aiming to save for retirement, start a business, or achieve financial independence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_99000\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vuF47QMHIwQ?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vuF47QMHIwQ\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Charlie Munger is Warren Buffet&#8217;s partner and friend at Berkshire Hathaway.
