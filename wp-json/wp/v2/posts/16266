Credit card debt, student loans, and mortgages are among the most significant contributors to individual debt burdens.

This highlights the financial vulnerability of many individuals and families.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Income inequality: Income inequality has been a growing concern in many countries. According to Oxfam, in 2020, the world&#8217;s billionaires saw their wealth increase by over $3.9 trillion, while the poorest half of the global population experienced a decline in wealth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Retirement savings shortfall: Many people face challenges when it comes to saving for retirement. In the United States, a study by the Economic Policy Institute found that almost half of working-age families have no retirement savings, and the median retirement account balance for those nearing retirement is only around $21,000.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mental health impact: Financial stress can have a significant impact on mental health. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, money is consistently one of the top stressors for Americans, and it can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inflation: Inflation is hitting everyone, <a href=\"https:\/\/money.com\/inflation-hitting-middle-class-hard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">especially the middle class hard!<\/a>&nbsp; The Fed is desperately trying to get a handle on inflation, but inflation does seem to in fact be like toothepaste, once out of the tube it is mighty messy to put back in.

Here are three things you can do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assess-and-prioritize-your-expenses\"><strong>Assess and prioritize your expenses:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>to cope with stress, start by evaluating your financial situation and identifying your essential expenses, such as housing, food, utilities, and transportation. Create a budget to allocate your available funds to cover these necessities first. Look for areas where you can reduce discretionary spending and cut back on non-essential items until your finances stabilize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"seek-professional-advice-and-assistance\"><strong>Seek professional advice and assistance:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out for professional help. Consult with a financial advisor or credit counselor who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances. They can help you create a personalized plan, negotiate with creditors, and explore potential solutions, such as debt consolidation or restructuring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"explore-additional-income-sources\"><strong>Explore additional income sources:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider supplementing your current income by exploring additional sources of revenue. This could involve taking up a part-time job, freelancing, or starting a small side business based on your skills and interests. Generating extra income can provide a temporary financial boost and help you overcome immediate challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exercise-health\"><strong>Exercise &amp; Health:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What better way to cope with stress than exercise and focusing on health?
