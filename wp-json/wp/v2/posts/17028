Anyone who has spent time managing a health issue knows that quality of life depletes rapidly when worried, stressed and consumed with managing a health crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-we-can-control\"><strong>What we can control<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot control all health situations, but there are some areas we can engineer our lives for better overall energy, clarity and health. One specific area is heart health. Unfortunately due to bad habits, lifestyle choices and environmental factors, heart disease remains a number one destroyer of health. So what can do to improve this situation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 fundamentals each day<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally look for simple and straightforward approaches to all things health and investing. So for me personally I try and ask myself 3 basic questions each day:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-what-i-am-eating-real-food-or-is-it-highly-processed-and-loaded-with-sugar-or-unhealthy-fats-and-stripped-of-all-nutrients\"><strong>-Is what I am eating &#8220;real&#8221; food? Or is it highly processed and loaded with sugar or unhealthy fats and stripped of all nutrients?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not have a perfect diet. But, because I am in the habit of asking this question, my diet is much better than it would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"did-i-move-today-did-i-lift-something-heavy-and-or-get-my-heart-rate-up\"><strong>-Did I move today? Did I lift something heavy and\/or get my heart rate up?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not go to a fancy gym. I basically try and incorporate as much movement into my life as possible each day. Another heart healthy habit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"did-i-do-something-today-to-care-for-my-mental-and-emotional-health\"><strong>-Did I do something today to care for my mental and emotional health?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This question has to do with managing stress. We all have stress, it is part of life. And it appears that some stress is actually good for us. But, chronic unrelenting stress that leads to hopelessness is not good. So we must find ways to spend quality time with friends and family. Do some kind of hobby we enjoy. Get in touch with nature and more. Another heart healthy habit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"according-to-the-experts-here-are-the-main-5-things-we-can-do-to-improve-our-hearth-health\">According to the experts, here are the main 5 things we can do to improve our hearth health.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-top-5-heart-healthy-habits-are\"><strong>The top 5 heart healthy habits are:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Eat a healthy diet.&nbsp;A heart-healthy diet is low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar. It is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get regular exercise.&nbsp;Aim for&nbsp;at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week.&nbsp;You can also break this up into shorter sessions throughout the day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintain a healthy weight.&nbsp;Being overweight or obese puts you at increased risk for heart disease. If you are overweight or obese, talk to your doctor about how to lose weight safely.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.&nbsp;Smoking damages your heart and blood vessels and increases your risk for heart disease. Secondhand smoke is also harmful to your heart health. If you smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do for your heart health.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manage stress.&nbsp;Stress can raise your blood pressure and heart rate and increase your risk for heart disease. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Following these five heart healthy habits can help you reduce your risk of heart disease and live a longer, healthier life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some additional tips for following these habits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat more fruits and vegetables.Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at every meal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose whole grains over refined grains.&nbsp;Whole grains are a good source of fiber, which can help lower your cholesterol levels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limit saturated and trans fats.Saturated and trans fats can raise your cholesterol levels. Choose healthy fats, such as those found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limit sodium.&nbsp;Too much sodium can raise your blood pressure. Aim for no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get regular checkups.&nbsp;See your doctor for regular checkups and screenings. This can help you identify any risk factors for heart disease early on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.heart.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.heart.org<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahajournals.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.ahajournals.org<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Making small changes to your diet and lifestyle can make a big difference in your heart health.
