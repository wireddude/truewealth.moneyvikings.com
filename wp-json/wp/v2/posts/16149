S<span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">top doing these things<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-avoid-excessive-spending\"><strong>1. Avoid excessive spending<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key factors in accumulating wealth is to avoid unnecessary and impulsive spending. Make a budget and stick to it, distinguishing between needs and wants. Avoid accumulating debt through credit cards or loans, as high-interest payments can hinder your financial progress.<span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">top doing these things<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-avoid-poor-financial-habits\"><strong>2. Avoid poor financial habits<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is tied to number one, but includes a broader range of bad habits and neglect. Poor financial habits like procrastinating on saving, neglecting investments, or failing to plan for the future can hinder wealth accumulation. Develop good financial habits, such as saving a portion of your income regularly, investing wisely, and setting clear financial goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This goes firmly in the bucket of &#8220;stop doing these things if you want to be rich&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-avoid-excessive-risk-taking\"><strong>3. Avoid excessive risk-taking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While taking calculated risks can lead to financial gains, excessive risk-taking without proper knowledge or research can be detrimental to your wealth. Avoid gambling, speculative investments, or get-rich-quick schemes. Instead, focus on long-term investments with a balanced risk-reward ratio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the meme stock crazy times many people took excessive risk into the hot new thing. Whether it be crypto or a meme stock, they would probably have bee better off with a good old fashioned index fund and a properly risk balanced portfolio. Check out my<a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/02\/money-vikings-dividend-portf\/\" target=\"_blank\"> all weather portfolio here!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-avoid-relying-on-a-single-income-source\"><strong>4. Avoid relying on a single income source<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying solely on a single income source can limit your wealth potential. Create multiple streams of income, such as investments, side businesses, or freelance work. Diversifying your income sources helps to create stability and provides opportunities for wealth growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly grow wealth and become resilient we need several sources of income. Some of these take years to set up like privately owned real estate while others can be formed in a matter of an hour like buying quality dividend paying stocks.

Avoid ignoring education and self-improvement<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuous learning and self-improvement are crucial for increasing your earning potential and building wealth. Avoid complacency and invest in your education and skills. Stay updated with industry trends, explore new opportunities, and enhance your knowledge to remain competitive in the job market or business world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, becoming rich is a complex process that involves discipline, perseverance, and strategic decision-making. It&#8217;s important to tailor these suggestions to your specific circumstances and develop a personalized approach to wealth-building. Do not neglect your financial education, we must stop doing these types of things if we want to be rich.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please consider becoming a Money Viking member, check out our book and more for a wealth of knowledge specifically on making you stronger in many ways!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon wp-block-embed-amazon\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Conquer Financial Freedom: Living a Life of True Wealth\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"550\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https:\/\/read.amazon.com\/kp\/card?preview=inline&#038;linkCode=kpe&#038;ref_=k4w_oembed_ieYagHMuinkk0C&#038;asin=B0BRJW92XV&#038;tag=kpembed-20\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few of my biggest investing and money mistakes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_87170\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hTxKHRDyHjw?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hTxKHRDyHjw\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are Azul&#8217;s Rules which we love:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_27207\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jQLOU0ESxps?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jQLOU0ESxps\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, sometimes success is more about stop doing these things.
