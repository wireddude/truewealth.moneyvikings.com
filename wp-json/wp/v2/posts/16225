There are many benefits to health and aging to this practice. And I find it interesting that for thousands of years many religious practices incorporate a period of fasting as a regular practice. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">benefits of intermittent fasting<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-simple-approach\"><strong>My Simple Approach<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like simple approaches to things in life and that includes intermittent fasting. So for me, stopping eating in the evening by 7 and then skipping breakfast allows my body a longer period of fasting than normal. If I do not eat until around 11, then that is a 15 hour period of no food, just water, coffee or tea. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">benefits of intermittent fasting<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/wellness-and-prevention\/intermittent-fasting-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More approaches and overview here at Johns Hopkins.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fasting-trigger\"><strong>Fasting Trigger<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What exactly does intermittent fasting do for us Money Vikings? Fasting somehow triggers defense mechanisms in the body that make us stronger and healthier. It also seems to allow for the body and cells to clear out debris. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">benefits of intermittent fasting<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fasting triggers several physiological and metabolic changes in the human body. Some of the key responses include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Insulin regulation: When you fast, especially for extended periods, your body&#8217;s insulin levels decrease. This allows stored body fat to be broken down and used as an energy source.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Autophagy: Fasting stimulates a process called autophagy, which is the body&#8217;s way of removing and recycling damaged cells and cellular components. This process helps maintain cellular health, promotes rejuvenation, and can have anti-aging effects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased human growth hormone (HGH) production: Fasting can lead to increased secretion of human growth hormone (HGH), a hormone that plays a crucial role in growth, metabolism, and muscle strength. Higher levels of HGH can facilitate fat burning and muscle growth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cellular repair and regeneration: Fasting triggers cellular repair processes. During periods of fasting, the body initiates DNA repair mechanisms and activates genes that help protect against disease and enhance cellular resilience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhanced ketosis: When you fast for an extended period, the body depletes its stored glycogen (glucose) reserves. As a result, the body starts breaking down stored fat to produce ketones, which can serve as an alternative energy source. This metabolic state is known as ketosis and has been associated with various health benefits.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved metabolic flexibility: Fasting can enhance metabolic flexibility, which is the body&#8217;s ability to switch between using different fuel sources efficiently. This flexibility allows the body to adapt to different energy demands and improves overall metabolic health.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benefits\"><strong>Benefits<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of intermittent fasting are gaining popularity as a dietary approach due to its potential health benefits. Here are five benefits associated with intermittent fasting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Weight loss: Intermittent fasting can be an effective strategy for weight loss. By limiting the window of time in which you eat, you naturally reduce your overall caloric intake. Additionally, fasting periods can enhance fat burning by increasing insulin sensitivity and boosting human growth hormone levels. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">benefits of intermittent fasting<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved insulin sensitivity: Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, which is beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. It helps regulate blood sugar levels by reducing insulin resistance and promoting better glucose control.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhanced cellular repair: During fasting periods, your body initiates cellular repair processes, including autophagy. Autophagy is the body&#8217;s way of removing and recycling damaged cells and cellular components, promoting cellular rejuvenation and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">benefits of intermittent fasting<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduced inflammation: Chronic inflammation is associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Intermittent fasting may help reduce inflammation markers in the body, leading to improved overall health and a lower risk of chronic diseases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brain health and longevity: Some studies suggest that intermittent fasting may have positive effects on brain health. It may enhance brain function, improve cognitive performance, and protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s. Additionally, intermittent fasting has been associated with increased lifespan in animal studies, although more research is needed to confirm these findings in humans.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, such as individuals with certain medical conditions or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It&#8217;s always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"videos-on-intermittent-fasting\"><strong>Videos on Intermittent Fasting:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_90948\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0wVKxrLNEoM?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0wVKxrLNEoM\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_82222\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/n9IxomBusuw?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n9IxomBusuw\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For more Money Viking Health articles and ideas check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/category\/health\/\" target=\"_blank\">Money Viking Health Section.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are the benefits of intermittent fasting? *not health advice to anyone, see your healthcare provider before starting any kind of fasting regiment.
