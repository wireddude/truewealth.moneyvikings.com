US companies will continue to dominate for many decades to come. Most of the worlds greatest companies came from the US and will continue to do so. I do seek exposure to emerging markets, but I am going to chose these even more carefully going forward with an eye on geopolitical risks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>AI and Tech<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>AI and Tech are other fields that I believe will continue to flourish and dominate in the years to come.

None of this can be stopped.In terms of AI and Tech, this may also be a time to invest in defense industry tech that will be used to push back on rogue states and actions should it come to world war 3, or just war. Raytheon has been a favorite dividend player for quite some time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quality Bonds<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The raging 20&#8217;s all about risk management and diversification of assets.

Now with inflation running so hot, and fears of world war 3 \u00a0this became tricky because money sitting in low interest rate cash accounts loses purchasing power quickly. But, inflation should hopefully continue to smooth into next year and having cash has many advantages. For one, cash gives you opportunity. It is opportunity in an unmanifesred potential to jump on market dips and pick up assets on sale.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reduce Costs and Debt<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think we need to get used to l<a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/01\/declutter-finances-build-wealth\/\" target=\"_blank\">iving more simply<\/a> over the next decade.
