As the&nbsp;climate transitions to and we consider the future, I truly believe we must be good stewards of our environment, but not for the environment, for us. <strong><i>Here is my greedy green thinking: If we destroy the environment, we destroy our health, our enjoyment and our children&#8217;s futures.

In other words, it has nothing to do with the bugs, bunnies and trees, I am concerned with us. And this thinking led me to ESG investing a few years back, which stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. The idea being that the companies are screened so as not to contain companies that are doing &#8220;bad things&#8221; to the environment, to people (society) and are being governed in an ethical manner.
