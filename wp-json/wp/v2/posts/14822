We go beyond just achieving a specific financial independence number, that is just simple math. What about our health and relationships? Well, onions may do a lot of good for your health, wealth and relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5 Health Benefits<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Onions are used in many different types of cuisine. Not only do they add flavor and texture to a variety of dishes, but they also offer several health benefits. Here are the top five health benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Boost Immune System: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/onion-benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onions<\/a> contain antioxidants that help to boost the immune system, preventing diseases and infections. They are also high in vitamin C, which is important for maintaining a healthy immune system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anti-inflammatory Properties: contain compounds called flavonoids that have anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds help to reduce inflammation in the body, which can help to prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Regulate Blood Sugar: contain compounds that help to regulate blood sugar levels. This can be beneficial for people with diabetes, as it can help to control their blood sugar levels and prevent complications.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve Heart Health: Onions contain compounds that help to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. They also contain a compound called quercetin, which has been shown to have heart-protective effects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve Digestion: Onions contain prebiotics, which are a type of fiber that helps to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This can help to improve digestion and prevent digestive issues such as constipation and diarrhea.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>So add them to pizza, sandwiches, pasta dishes and more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/15350034896_fa1c8dd0f3_b-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"onions\" class=\"wp-image-14850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/15350034896_fa1c8dd0f3_b.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/15350034896_fa1c8dd0f3_b.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/15350034896_fa1c8dd0f3_b.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>onions are awesome, put them on pizza, put them on garlic, put them in your milkshake and blend it with some fish.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":14824,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"categories":[13,21],"tags":[535,1053],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/onion-health-benefits-e1677432409325.jpeg?fit=1000%2C825&ssl=1","jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":15420,"url":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/10\/mediterranean-diet\/","url_meta":{"origin":14822,"position":0},"title":"5 Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet","author":"greg","date":"October 22, 2023","format":false,"excerpt":"A key aspect of True Wealth is our health.
