We will cover 5 healthiest foods backed by scientific research. These foods also tend to just taste great, which is a part of living a life of True Wealth. My diet is not perfect and I certainly indulge in the occasional junk food. But as I get older I want to focus more and more on the healthiest possible foods.<\/p>\n<p>In general, healthier foods help our bodies repair normal cell damage, keep our arteries clean and help protect us from disease. In addition, healthier foods help us reduce chronic inflammation, a major contributor to disease, aging and pain.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Real, mostly veg and not too much<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After years of confusing food headlines and reccomendations, I finally stumbled upon Michael Pollens series of books. In the omnivores dilemma he creates one simple mantra for eating that I think is brilliant.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Eat real food, mainly plant based and not too much.<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>I love the simplicity of this and how it actually creates space for real life. Notice he is not saying to swear off sweets or meat or carbs. He is just basically saying that for most of the time try and each real unprocessed foods. Try and add as many vegetables and plants to the diet and try to not over eat.<\/p>\n<p>5 Healthiest Foods<\/p>\n<p>There are many healthy foods to choose from, but here are five that are particularly nutritious and beneficial for your overall health:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Leafy green vegetables<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Vegetables such as kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are low in calories, but high in fiber, which makes them an excellent choice for weight management. Leafy greens like spinach are clearly huge winners in the top 5 healthiest foods.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Berries<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Berries such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are packed with antioxidants, which help to protect your body against cell damage. They are also rich in fiber and vitamins, and are low in calories. I try to add these to smoothies when I can in order to incorporate the 5 healthiest foods into my regular diet.<\/p>\n<p>For more about berries, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amenclinics.com\/blog\/dr-amens-7-brain-superfoods-for-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Amens brain superfoods!<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Fatty fish<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for good health. Omega-3 fatty acids help to reduce inflammation in the body, which can help to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions.<\/p>\n<p>I try and eat either Fish Tacos or sushi a couple times a week. This way my brain and arteries are getting some healthy omega 3 fatty acids. Fatty fish is an essential element of the proven and healthy Mediterranean diet:<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\">\n<div  id=\"_ytid_65131\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Qrllwh0YMgI?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qrllwh0YMgI\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><strong>4.
