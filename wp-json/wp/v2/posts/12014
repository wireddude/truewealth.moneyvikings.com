In other words, we all have a unique financial and life journey and we are the star of our saga. But how can we map this journey out to increase our chance at success?

Approximately 20 million people in the US have a negative net financial worth. We talk a lot about calculating your financial net worth as a way to assess overall financial health. This is typically our college\/apprentice years followed by a few years that follow. Obviously, most of us spend quite a bit on an upfront investment to gain an education and get established within a career field or vocation. Most people are in debt. But what we want to do at this stage is get ourselves into a break even position. This takes a combination of paying down debt and at the same time building positions in assets\/savings. The key would be a regular debt payment plan (most likely for school loans or car loans), etc. It is critical in this stage to reduce expenses as much as possible. This means deferring luxury purchases, sharing homes and apartments to cut down on living expenses, etc. Another key action in this stage is to automatically invest or save in some manner.

A person has achieved some level of steady income at a healthy level. At this stage one can easily service debt, pay living expenses and enjoy a little extra each month. According to some economic analysis this stage is hit around making $90k\/year, adjusted for local cost of living. It is important at this stage to recognize that the issue here is accumulation of assets and pay down of debt. AtThere is nothing wrong with the $90k\/year income, but in this stage the person does not have a lot of assets compounding and building more wealth.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\r\n<h2>FINANCIAL STRENGTH LEVEL 3:\u00a0VIKING HEALTH<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:image {\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/miro.medium.com\/max\/875\/1*vgfbJJ4mBs0yBYyb0RL_OQ.jpeg?resize=640%2C423&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"5 Levels of Financial Strength\" width=\"640\" height=\"423\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Photo by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@gioele_fazzeri_89?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gioele Fazzeri<\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/viking?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Unsplash<\/a><\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p id=\"fe50\">Here is where in my opinion things start to get fun! There is no exact income per year that equates to a \u201chealthy\u201d financial picture, but I believe we can describe what this looks like. To me, this is when a person is pretty well established in their regular career or job, is regularly contributing to a retirement account with a balance of stock and bond funds, has built a small emergency stash. This person is paying things on time and building credit so that said credit can be leveraged in the future. One more key aspect of this stage is to be continuously learning about investing and financial knowledge. This is a key education stage, just as critical as formal education in your earlier years.
