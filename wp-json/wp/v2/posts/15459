We have been talking about a recession as a society for over a year. And it just doesn&#8217;t seem to arrive. Much to the chagrin of the Federal reserve bent on breaking something in the economy so that inflation will come down. Perhaps inflation is coming, no one knows. If do have one, what are some recession investments that can weather the storm?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"an-abundance-agenda\"><strong>An Abundance Agenda<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would rather see us humans develop an abundance agenda versus breaking the economy. This would increase the supply of things people need and thus bring the prices to more affordable levels.

But those nice stable investment returns and appreciation of capital are sure nice, it is like the demand cannot keep up with supply when it comes to real estate. But if you do not want to respond to maintenance calls, have you heard of a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)? This article will talk all about REITs and compare them to traditional &#8220;hands on&#8221; real estate investing. Real Estate, as you can see is a Great Recession Investments Vehicle!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write a lot about <a href=\"https:\/\/themoneyvikings.net\/2018\/12\/15\/analyzing-a-real-estate-investment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate<\/a> because I have a passion for it as a thing and as an investment vehicle. It may have something to do with my arts background, but I enjoy a well designed and well maintained property. Think about how essential real estate is to our modern lives. It keeps us safe, healthy and provides a platform for some of our greatest family memories. It is the grocery store, mall, coffee shop, warehouse, office complex, fast food joint, pharmacy, etc. Real estate in general is an excellent asset class in many ways. But it is important to consider all the pros and cons of the different ways to invest in real estate. <strong>In this article we focus on one that can be very easy to enter and easy to manage, high quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this article we focus on 3 easy ways to enter and easy to manage, high quality real estate recession investment trusts, or REITs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":15487,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"categories":[16],"tags":[1098,1097],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/recession-investments-1-e1678839157592.jpeg?fit=997%2C1113&ssl=1","jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":15631,"url":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/03\/how-to-become-a-millionaire-during-a-recession\/","url_meta":{"origin":15459,"position":0},"title":"How to Become a Millionaire During a Recession (3 Investments For This Recession From a Self Made Millionaire)","author":"greg","date":"March 30, 2023","format":false,"excerpt":"How to Become a Millionaire During a Recession","rel":"","context":"In &quot;Investing&quot;","block_context":{"text":"Investing","link":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/category\/investing\/"},"img":{"alt_text":"How to become a millionaire during a recession?","src":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/millionaire-recession.webp?fit=960%2C1200&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200","width":350,"height":200,"srcset":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/millionaire-recession.webp?fit=960%2C1200&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/millionaire-recession.webp?fit=960%2C1200&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/millionaire-recession.webp?fit=960%2C1200&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"},"classes":[]},{"id":12713,"url":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/01\/how-to-recession-proof-your-finances\/","url_meta":{"origin":15459,"position":1},"title":"Recession Proofing Your Finances &#8211; 6 Simple Things You Can Do Today!","author":"greg","date":"January 16, 2023","format":false,"excerpt":"Recession Proofing Your Finances - 6 Simple Things You Can Do Today!
