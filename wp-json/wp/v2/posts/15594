In this article we will explore what they are and what they can do for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-collagen-peptides\"><strong>What are collagen peptides?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collagen peptides are a type of protein supplement that is derived from collagen, a structural protein that is found in the body&#8217;s connective tissues, such as skin, bones, tendons, and cartilage. Below we list the major food sources of collagen, but it can also be added as a supplement. Here are five benefits of collagen peptide supplements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"improved-skin-health\"><strong>Improved skin health<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collagen peptides can improve skin health by increasing skin elasticity, hydration, and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This is because collagen is a major component of the skin and helps to maintain its structure. Who doesn&#8217;t want healthier looking skin?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"joint-health\"><strong>Joint health<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collagen peptides may help to improve joint health by reducing inflammation, improving joint mobility, and reducing pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stronger-bones\"><strong>Stronger bones<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collagen is a major component of bones, and studies have shown that collagen peptide supplements may help to improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. This is critical as we age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_66680\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/juKy4HfCdmw?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/juKy4HfCdmw\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"muscle-mass\"><strong>Muscle mass<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collagen peptides have been shown to increase muscle mass and strength, especially when combined with resistance training.

While our bodies naturally produce collagen, the production of collagen decreases as we age, making it important to obtain it through our diet. Here are some food sources of collagen:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bone Broth: Made by simmering bones and connective tissue of animals such as chicken, beef, and fish. It&#8217;s a rich source of collagen and other nutrients.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beef and Pork: Beef and pork contain collagen in their connective tissues, including tendons, cartilage, and skin. Consuming cuts of meat with these tissues can increase collagen intake.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chicken: Chicken is also a good source of collagen, especially in the skin and cartilage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fish: Fish such as salmon, tuna, and cod contain collagen in their skin and bones.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Egg Whites: Egg whites are rich in a protein called proline, which is a key component of collagen.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Citrus Fruits: Citrus fruits contain vitamin C, which is essential for collagen production in the body.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leafy Greens: Leafy greens like spinach and kale contain antioxidants that help protect collagen from damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Berries: Berries are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which can help support collagen production.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nuts and Seeds: Nuts and seeds contain amino acids, which are essential for collagen production.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gelatin: Gelatin is a protein-rich food that is made from collagen-rich animal bones, skin, and connective tissue.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essential-to-life\"><strong>Essential to Life<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can see, collagen is essential to life and health. As we age we may need more.
