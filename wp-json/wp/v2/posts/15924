So here are more ideas to achieve your goals of ultimate fitness and ultimate wealth!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sometimes it is what we DO NOT do<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Just like in investing, sometimes with our health, it is what we avoid rather than what we actually do that can make a difference. In investing and finance we like to say that we should avoid the major mistakes: too much debt, overpriced cars, shopping addictions, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Same for health. There are certain foods we can minimize or avoid to lower inflammation. Inflammation is a natural process that helps the body heal and fight infection, but chronic inflammation can contribute to a number of health problems. Some foods are known to increase inflammation in the body. There are specific categories of foods that should be limited or avoided in order to lower the risk of chronic inflammation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Why is Chronic Inflammation Bad?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>First it is important to understand that the inflammatory response is a natural response when the body is protecting of healing itself. But Chronic inflammation (persisting for a long time) is linked to many diseases.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here are seven foods that may cause inflammation:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Sugar: Eating too much sugar can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can trigger inflammation. It&#8217;s important to limit your intake of sugary drinks, desserts, and processed foods.<\/li>\n<li>Trans fats: Trans fats are found in many processed foods, including fried foods, baked goods, and snack foods. They can increase inflammation and contribute to a number of health problems, including heart disease.<\/li>\n<li>Omega-6 fatty acids: While omega-6 fatty acids are an essential nutrient, too much of them can contribute to inflammation. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids include vegetable oils (like corn, soybean, and sunflower oil), fried foods, and processed snacks. I try to ensure I am reaching a balance with Omega 3 fatty acids found in salmon, tuna and olive oil that are good for us and decrease inflammation.<\/li>\n<li>Red meat: Red meat is high in saturated fat, which can contribute to inflammation. It&#8217;s important to limit your intake of red meat and opt for lean protein sources, like chicken, fish, and plant-based proteins.<\/li>\n<li>Refined carbohydrates: Foods high in refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and rice) can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, which can trigger inflammation. Opt for whole grain options instead.<\/li>\n<li>Alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can increase inflammation in the body. It&#8217;s important to limit your alcohol intake and drink in moderation. Sure, there is some research that points to some minor health benefits of a a couple glasses of wine each week, but this must be managed appropriately.<\/li>\n<li>Artificial additives: Artificial additives like preservatives and food coloring can cause inflammation in some people. Try to choose foods that are minimally processed and free of artificial additives. There are so many products in grocery stores that are loaded with aritificial additives. Beware of packaging that lists tons of ingredients that are hard to pronounce, this is typically not real food!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><strong>See Your Healthcare Provider<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is general guidance that I am trying to follow to improve health. See your personal healthcare provider or a nutritionist to develop a plan that is individual to your needs and specific situation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mediterranean Diet<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Mediterranean diet in particular seems to lower the inflammatory response in humans. Check out our overview of this way of eating:<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\">\n<div  id=\"_ytid_97566\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Qrllwh0YMgI?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qrllwh0YMgI\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Other Resources:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\">\n<div  id=\"_ytid_40859\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UVK1Q1iwGjU?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVK1Q1iwGjU\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>We hope this and all of our content inspires you to live a strong Money Viking life!
