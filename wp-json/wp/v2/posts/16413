For the record, I am not talking about becoming a billionaire. That is very rare and typically involves some element of being in the right place at the right time and other factors outside our control. Or it involves some very unique set of circumstances. I am not saying famous actors, sports stars or tech entrepreneurs are not hard working; but when you dig deep into their lives there was typically a set of circumstances and luck beyond their influence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am talking about steps to build wealth and live a very comfortable upper middle class life that almost anyone can replicate if they get some basics down and stick to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"our-definition-of-wealth\"><strong>Our definition of wealth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the average net worth of US households was $300k. The median net worth for someone 35-44 years old in the US is about $91k. This goes up to $168,000 for people ages 45-54.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am talking about blowing past this all together and building some substantial wealth in the first half of your life, by about age 49. So for sake of definitions let&#8217;s peg that number at double the average net worth to $600k. This will put you clear onto steps to build wealth ASAP. This goal would probably put you on a clear course to hitting that psychological $1 million mark and put a person well into the the top 15% of wealthy households in the country and world.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"true-wealth\"><strong>True Wealth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would also like to combine this number with 2 other factors we talk about a lot: health and relationships. A life of True Wealth is more than a number. That is why I personally combine my calculations with overall health management and connections to other people. For me, many of these connections just happen to come through collectibles and games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-steps-to-build-wealth\"><strong>7 Steps to Build Wealth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building wealth is a process that requires discipline, planning, and persistence. BUT, with intense focus on setting things up, I believe someone can replicate the success of others and hit those high net worth figures. While there&#8217;s no guaranteed way to amass wealth quickly, here are seven proven steps that can help you build wealth over time:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-automate-paying-yourself-first\"><strong>1. Automate Paying Yourself First:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am convinced this is the single most important and easy step one can take to build wealth. It&#8217;s so easy and straightforward that people typically just blow past it. Building wealth must be more complicated they think? There must be a magic formula that only the elites know?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s butt ass basic. If you have regular and gainful employment, automate to have a certain percentage of your take home pay automatically swept away and placed into an investment vehicle. For me this is a basic low cost set of a few index funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must understand this, life is not like the movies. A magical moment does not exist in real life, that is the stuff of fantasy. Life is about one small step each and every day. And over time you look back and may be amazed by how far you have come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, compare this to someone that just stand there and flails about waiting for that magical moment when everything falls into place. It never happens. And when they look back after years they have made no progress. They are standing and flailing and waiting in the same spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-reduce-debt-and-avoid-unnecessary-liabilities\"><strong>2. Reduce debt and avoid unnecessary liabilities:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt and liabilities must be tamed to build wealth fast. One of the things that got us working on Money Vikings content years ago was finding methods to destroy debt. Watch some Caleb Hammer videos and you will be in shock at the debt decisions and behavior of millions of folks. I am not mad at them, I feel very sad for them. They are handing their lives and energy over to what others think and those willing to prey on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_43664\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/87qL_bZnAMk?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/87qL_bZnAMk\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize paying off high-interest debts such as credit card debt or personal loans. Avoid accumulating unnecessary liabilities that don&#8217;t contribute to your financial well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"special-mention-cars\"><strong>Special mention: cars<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember you are not what you drive. Americans spend a fortune on cars. And there is a huge opportunity cost to car ownership. Therefore if you want to build wealth fast, ensure it is not being eaten up by some exorbitant car payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-save-and-invest-wisely\"><strong>3. Save and invest wisely:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building wealth quickly is about investing wisely. I am thankful the <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/10\/meme-stock-madness-is-dead-time-to-get-back-to-basics-of-wealth-building\/\" target=\"_blank\">pandemic fueled meme stock craze is dead<\/a>, I hated it. There are central tenants to investing that should be understood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build an emergency fund that can cover three to six months&#8217; worth of living expenses. Financial experts will say do this before investing, but I personally disagree. I still think the first step is to automate. Otherwise a person could get stick by never achieving the emergency fund and never get around to investing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have a sufficient emergency fund, start investing in assets that have the potential to grow your wealth over time, such as stocks, real estate, or mutual funds. Consider diversifying your investments to minimize risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to stick to the basics at first for investing. I choose those long term tried and true assets: diversified stock funds, ETF&#8217;s, bond funds, real estate investment trusts, real estate, and maybe some small exposure to alternative investments like precious metals and collectibles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main point is that wealthy people invest in things that have a proven track record of returns. They are not dropping everything into the latest crypto craze, meme stock or complicated investing scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out my <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/02\/money-vikings-dividend-portf\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride My Bike Portfolio construction!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also check out this great list at <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/wealth\/ways-to-build-wealth-fast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BankRate<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Save.

Buy a home:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My next move to build wealth is to buy a home that I can comfortably manage, afford and enjoy. A great percentage of people&#8217;s net worth is tied up in their homes. A home is an asset we can use\/enjoy and build equity in over time. I have several videos about the pros and cons of investing in a home, but I generally believe it is good for many people in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also allows options down the road. Let&#8217;s say after a decade you decide you no longer want to own a home. Well, you will have a decade worth of equity to cash out on that would have otherwise gone to rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><div  id=\"_ytid_52524\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" data-facadesrc=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/OhwOUqyCHgs?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;controls=1&#038;color=red&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__ epyt-facade epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" data-epautoplay=\"1\" ><img decoding=\"async\" data-spai-excluded=\"true\" class=\"epyt-facade-poster skip-lazy\" loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"YouTube player\"  src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OhwOUqyCHgs\/hqdefault.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\"  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><button class=\"epyt-facade-play\" aria-label=\"Play\"><svg data-no-lazy=\"1\" height=\"100%\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 68 48\" width=\"100%\"><path class=\"ytp-large-play-button-bg\" d=\"M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z\" fill=\"#f00\"><\/path><path d=\"M 45,24 27,14 27,34\" fill=\"#fff\"><\/path><\/svg><\/button><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-focus-on-health-low-cost-pursuits\"><strong>5. Focus on Health &amp; Low Cost Pursuits<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we need things to fill our time that are not costly. People notouriously spend money unconsciously when they are bored, tired or just do not know what to do with their time. There are so many things we can do that do not cost much and are healthy for us. This is another step to build wealth fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about this as a free proposal, focus on your health as another way to build wealth. Walking, biking, playing with kids, selecting a healthy recipe, researching healthy food options are all inexpensive ways to build wealth.
